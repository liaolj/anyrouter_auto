# AnyRouter Auto

> Minimal-dependency CLI helper to automate the daily sign-in on [anyrouter.top](https://anyrouter.top/).

## Features

- Generates OAuth authorization URL for the GitHub login flow and captures the callback via a lightweight local HTTP server.
- Opens the authorization link with the default system browser (or lets you copy it manually) for GitHub sign-in.
- Stores access and refresh tokens using a JSON file with optional passphrase-based obfuscation.
- Provides `authorize`, `signin`, `status`, `schedule`, and `clear` commands via a single CLI entry point.
- Persists sign-in history in CSV format for later inspection.
- Ships a simple daily scheduler implemented with the Python standard library only.

## Installation

The project targets Python 3.11+. Create a virtual environment and install the package locally:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e .
```

## Configuration

Create a GitHub OAuth application for `https://anyrouter.top/` (or request the client identifier from the service owner). Supply this identifier in one of the following ways:

- Export the `ANYROUTER_CLIENT_ID` environment variable before running the CLI; **or**
- Pass `--client-id <value>` to the `authorize` command; **or**
- Simply run `anyrouter-auto authorize` and enter the value interactively when prompted.

The CLI stores the provided client identifier alongside the OAuth tokens, so subsequent `signin`/`schedule` runs do not require the environment variable. Adjust the daily schedule via the `ANYROUTER_SCHEDULE_HOUR` and `ANYROUTER_SCHEDULE_MINUTE` variables if needed.

Invoke the CLI with either the hyphenated `anyrouter-auto` script name or the underscore variant `anyrouter_auto`â€”both entry points are installed for convenience.

## Usage

1. **Authorize**
   ```bash
   anyrouter-auto authorize --client-id <github_client_id>
   ```
   Omit `--client-id` if you exported `ANYROUTER_CLIENT_ID` or prefer to type the identifier when prompted. The command prints the authorization URL and attempts to launch it with your system browser so you can finish the GitHub login flow. After granting access, the CLI exchanges the authorization code and stores the resulting tokens (including the client identifier) in `~/.anyrouter_auto/credentials.json`. If the browser cannot be opened automatically, copy the printed URL manually.

2. **Manual sign-in**
   ```bash
   anyrouter-auto signin  # or: anyrouter_auto signin
   ```
   The CLI refreshes expired access tokens automatically (if a refresh token is available), performs the sign-in request, and logs the result to `history.csv`.

3. **Status overview**
   ```bash
   anyrouter-auto status
   ```
   Displays information about the stored credentials and prints the latest history entries.

4. **Daily scheduler**
   ```bash
   anyrouter-auto schedule
   ```
   Starts a background loop that executes the sign-in once per day. Stop the process with `Ctrl+C`.

5. **Clear credentials**
   ```bash
   anyrouter-auto clear
   ```
   Removes the stored credential file.

Pass `--passphrase` to `authorize`, `signin`, `status`, or `schedule` to protect the credential file with a user-provided secret.

## Development

- Code style follows standard library modules and keeps runtime dependencies minimal.
- Tests are not provided in this initial drop. You can verify import-time regressions with `python -m compileall anyrouter_auto`.

## Disclaimer

The HTTP endpoints used here are based on assumptions of the anyrouter.top API surface and may require adjustments to match the real service responses. Review and adapt the network calls (`anyrouter_auto/auth.py` and `anyrouter_auto/signin.py`) before using the tool in production.
